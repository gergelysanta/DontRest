Don't Rest! is an Apple Watch application which I started to implement because of my lazyness in the gym. Many times I find myself daydreaming or just listening the cool music which actually plays from my phone.

I found a lot of timer applications for timing the gym exercises (sets, rest between sets, etc.) but all of them needs manual tapping. I needed something which works automatically.

Don't Rest! will measure your activity based on your heart rate and will force you to continue the exercise by vibrating. That will be stop when your heart rate increases again...
